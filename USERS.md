# Asimov Users

This page lists research groups, institutions, and projects that use Asimov for gravitational wave analysis and other scientific workflows.

## Major Collaborations

### LIGO Scientific Collaboration
The LIGO Scientific Collaboration uses Asimov as the primary workflow management system for parameter estimation analyses of gravitational wave events.

**Notable Projects:**
- GWTC-2 (Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog 2)
- GWTC-2.1
- GWTC-3 (Third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog)
- GWTC-4.0 (Fourth Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog)
- O3 (Third Observing Run) catalog production
- Ongoing O4 observing run analyses

### Virgo Collaboration
The Virgo Collaboration, operating the Virgo detector in Italy, uses Asimov for joint LIGO-Virgo analyses.

### KAGRA Collaboration
The KAGRA Collaboration in Japan uses Asimov for analyses involving KAGRA data as part of the global gravitational wave detector network.

## Projects & Use Cases

### Catalog Production
Asimov has been used to produce multiple gravitational wave event catalogs, managing parameter estimation for hundreds of events across multiple pipelines.

### Rapid Response Analysis
Research groups use Asimov for quick preliminary parameter estimation of newly detected gravitational wave events to guide electromagnetic follow-up observations.

### Systematic Studies
Teams use Asimov to run systematic studies with varying analysis configurations, enabling reproducible comparison of pipeline performance and parameter estimation techniques.

### Multi-Messenger Astronomy
Asimov facilitates coordinated gravitational wave and electromagnetic analyses for multi-messenger events.

## Success Stories

### GWTC-3 Catalog Production
Asimov successfully managed parameter estimation for over 90 gravitational wave events across multiple pipelines, producing consistent, reproducible results that formed the basis of GWTC-3.

### Automated O3 Analysis
During the third observing run, Asimov enabled automated parameter estimation workflows that kept pace with detections, providing timely analysis results for the collaboration.
