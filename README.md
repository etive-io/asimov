# Asimov

Asimov is a python package used to construct automated bots to do various things with parameter esimation jobs for LIGO data analysis.
There are a number of bits of code which are designed to make writing your own bot easier, and these are importable, but there are also pre-baked bots.

## Pre-made bots

### Olivaw

Olivaw is the bot which was written to manage parameter estimation jobs for the O3a catalogue paper.
Once this package is installed it can be run as 

```$ olivaw```

on the command line. Note that this is expected to change in the near future as the package develops, however.
